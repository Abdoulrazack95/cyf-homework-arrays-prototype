# ToDo List Application

Some web designers have built a simple to-do list application, which should allow you to make a list of tasks you need to do. They need somebody to complete the logic for manipulating the array of to-do items. There are some blank functions in `HOMEWORK.js`, which will be called when you press particular buttons in the web page. You just need to make those functions do the right thing to the array of items.

## Instructions for development

1) Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (eg. Firefox, Google Chrome). 
2) Open `HOMEWORK.js` in your text editor.
3) Add the necessary logic to complete the empty functions.
4) Refresh the page in your web browser after each change to get the updated code.

## Desired features

The web designers would like the to-do list application to have the following features:
* Allow you to add new to-do list items by typing the task in the box and clicking 'add'.
* Remove to-do list items by clicking the cross on the right of each item.
* Mark the to-do as completed when you click on the tick on the left of each item.

There are some buttons beneath the list of to-do items which, from left to right, should:
* Clear _all_ items from the list, for you to start again
* Sort the list alphabetically, so that it is neat.
* Reverse the order of the list, so it is in the other direction
* Clear all _completed_ items from the list, to make space for tasks still to do
* Add exclamation marks to all to-do items, so that you will do them faster
* Display a box with the first item in the list that is not marked as done, so you know what to do first
